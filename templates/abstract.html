  <h1>Abstract</h1>
  <p>Online Social Network (OSN) is a network hub
where people with similar interests or real world relationships
interact. As the popularity of OSN is increasing, the security and
privacy issues related to it are also rising. Fake and Clone profiles
are creating dangerous security problems to social network users.
Cloning of user profiles is one serious threat, where already
existing userâ€™s details are stolen to create duplicate profiles and
then it is misused for damaging the identity of original profile
owner. They can even launch threats like phishing, stalking,
spamming etc. Fake profile is the creation of profile in the name
of a person or a company which does not really exist in social
media, to carry out malicious activities. In this paper, a detection
method has been proposed which can detect Fake and Clone
profiles in Twitter. Fake profiles are detected based on set of
rules that can effectively classify fake and genuine profiles. For
Profile Cloning detection two methods are used. One using
Similarity Measures and the other using C4.5 decision tree
algorithm. In Similarity Measures, two types of similarities are
considered Similarity of Attributes and Similarity of Network
relationships. C4.5 detects clones by building decision tree by
taking information gain into consideration. A comparison is made
to check how well these two methods help in detecting clone
profiles.
